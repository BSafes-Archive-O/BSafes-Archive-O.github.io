## Damage Done by Slavery and Native Genocides
*Slavery:* Five things were done intentionally to damage enslaved Africans psychologically.<sup>29</sup> First, they were beaten, tortured, and humiliated as warnings to all others of what would happen to them if any slave challenged or questioned their enslavement. They were abused with enough brutality to maintain constant fear of violent punishment. Second, slaves had

to be made to feel that they were powerless to stop or avoid the beatings, rapes, torture, and humiliation. Third, physical deprivation kept slaves’ attention fixed on momentary survival. This left them with little opportunity to ponder or plan resistance or escape and degraded their ability to successfully flee and survive if they escaped. Fourth, it was necessary to create total dependence among slaves on their masters and overseers. The more dependent they were in fact and mind, the greater was their powerlessness, the more immobilizing was fear of violence and sense of powerlessness. Finally, even if they had intimate relationships with their masters, they always needed to be aware that their slave master could unleash unspeakable violence against them.

The five conditions that psychologically damaged slaves were identical to the oppression used in World War II concentration camps. In both cases, slaves and camp inmates were intentionally and repeatedly traumatized to maintain compliance, order, and control. For camp inmates or slaves, their oppression became internalized and expressed through violence directed at one another, fearfulness, high anxiety, anger, deep depression, assimilation of a (racial) sense of inferiority, and child abuse and neglect.<sup>30</sup> These outcomes are precisely the International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders (ICD-10) symptoms for psychic trauma.<sup>31</sup> However, trauma symptoms for slaves are distinct from  concentration camp inmates in one way. Instead of being an outcome for several events or several years of trauma, slaves experienced traumatization over a lifetime, as did their children and children’s children. Abuse and trauma went on long enough and occurred frequently enough for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to become intrinsic to African American culture.<sup>32</sup> Slavery was a multi-generational holocaust.

Native Genocide: The present-day behavioral outcomes of Native American elimination are high rates of suicide, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, depression, anger, child abuse, and self and other disdain.<sup>33</sup> These outcomes are also consistent with the ICD-10 symptoms for psychic trauma.<sup>34</sup> As with enslaved Africans, the ICD-10 does not diagnose psychic traumas that have gone on repeatedly within and across generations. Tribal survivors, most of whom are on US Western reservations, have selective memories of their ritual, beliefs, and customs. Many are now re-imagining their culture, reconstructing rituals, and are making efforts to preserve their remaining languages.

Both African and native American survivors have evolved resilient subcultures from remnants of their original cultures. However, symptoms of PTSD experienced in genocide across generations have also become part of their ethnic cultures<sup>35</sup> and are reinforced now by present-day racism.<sup>36</sup> Can anything be done to reduce racism as one of the psychological legacies of African slavery and the elimination of Native Americans, and reverse generations of PTSD?
