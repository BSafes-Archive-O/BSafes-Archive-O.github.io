## Introduction
In the US, racism and its traumatic outcomes are the most significant and far-reaching legacy of the slave trade, slavery, and the elimination of Native peoples. By 1865, the African slave trade and slavery were ended as social institutions. The last Indian resistance occurred in 1890 just before the Wounded Knee massacre. What did not end were the attitudes, beliefs, and values that made slavery an intrinsic part of Southern life for over two hundred years, and that made the killing of Indian people necessary to settle the nation. A consequence is the treatment of freedmen and Indians as less than humans continues into the present with all their traumatic illeffects. One of the legacies of slavery’s beliefs, intrinsic to American racism, is the now scientifically discredited idea of races as biologically and anthropologically meaningful and distinct entities. Despite being thoroughly discredited, there is still an almost universal racial <sup>1</sup> self-identification of Americans as White, Black, Asian, and Indian; belief in races is as real today as it was in 1840. These identities were invented by Virginia and North Carolina colonial legislatures to justify and sustain slavery. The presumptive inferiority of Black and Native <sup>2</sup> Americans and the superiority of White Americans is slavery’s second legacy which frames contemporary attitudes and the treatment of African and Native Americans. In combination, these two historical beliefs made possible the selling and buying of humans as chattel, the justification for taking Indian lands, and are now at the core of the nation’s contemporary racism.

Racism does not originate nor is it sustained by individual shortcoming. After generations of belief and practice, racism’s core presumptions are expressed in three ways.<sup>3</sup> First, racial inferiority and superiority (hierarchy) are the mental blueprints of expected outcomes regarding race—racism is a cultural phenomenon. Second, the presumptions of racial hierarchy, embedded in culture, are actualized institutionally in education, housing, employment, and the application of the law and police practices—institutional racism. Third, consciously or unconsciously, individuals act out their cultural beliefs in racial hierarchy by maintaining racist institutional practices and outcomes—individual racism. A consistent result of these three expressions of racism is social and economic inequality by race across generations. Other results are the psychological costs of contemporary racism to all involved in

trauma and compromised health and well-being.<sup>4</sup> These are added to the still unresolved historical traumas of slavery and Indian elimination.

In this essay, we wish to demonstrate that the historical beliefs that made genocide possible in the US are the very same beliefs sustaining contemporary racism. Our first objective is to establish that the African slave trade, slavery, and the elimination of Native peoples in the US are acts of genocide and are distinct from more recent international genocides in scope, timeframe, and lack of termination. The second objective is to outline the psychological and cultural damage done by contemporary racism, slavery’s legacy. The final objective is to suggest a strategy to lessen racism in the US and to begin, at long last, reconciliation and healing from the effects of slavery and Indian genocides.
