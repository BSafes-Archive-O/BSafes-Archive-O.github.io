## III. COMMERCIALIZATION OF SPACE WITH NANOSATELLITES
*A. What Are Nanosatellites?*

Satellites are not new, but nanosatellites are. According to NASA, smallSats, CubeSats, and nanosatellites “vary depending on the application; some you can hold in your hand while others, like Hubble, are as big as a school bus.” <sup>48</sup> NASA said they can have a mass less than 180 kilograms, which it compared to a kitchen refrigerator. So, there is much variety.<sup>49</sup>

According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the total number of satellites in operation today is 2,787.<sup>50</sup> Of this number, the United States operates 1,425, but this number changes monthly. <sup>51</sup> The number is rising exponentially with nanosatellites being launched monthly into Low Earth Orbit (LEO), resulting in greater ease and lower cost. Back in 2017, the largest challenge recognized by researchers to full adoption was the unavailability of launch vehicles. <sup>52</sup> In 2021, commercial launch vendors such as SpaceX have overcome that challenge .<sup>53</sup> The new generation of nanosatellites launched by SpaceX is located in LEO, between 200 and 400 miles from the Earth. Later launches may be deployed at 710 miles, but that is still considerably closer to Earth than those launched in geostationary orbit (GSO) at 22,000 miles.<sup>54</sup>

The difference in distance helps dramatically with latency, as the shorter distance makes satellite internet more feasible. According to Elon Musk, SpaceX’s Starlink has “existing connections” which lag hundreds of milliseconds, but with “latency below 20 milliseconds…somebody could play a fast-response video game at a competitive level.”<sup>55</sup> With the dramatic improvement in time, options abound for satellite-based IoT devices.

Nanosatellite constellations are the future of IoT as early concepts are now in research, development, and production stages. <sup>56</sup> Designs of a “nanosatellite constellation” have come a long way since 2017, when the “conceptual design” for use “as an IoT communications platform” was

<sup>56</sup> “In recent years, the space industry has seen significant growth in numbers of sub 10kg satellite platforms now known more broadly in the industry as nanosatellites. Nanosatellites potential applicability is driven by flourishing technologies miniaturization in the consumer electronics market and commercialization of space. Currently nanosatellite mission operations are limited in both lifetime and maneuverability due to limitations in on board propulsion technologies. Further enhancement of mission operations relies on more effective integration of current reaction-mass-based propulsion technologies and further development of miniaturized propulsion systems.” Macario Rojas,* Design Considerations for LEO Nanosatellite Propulsion Technologies,* University of Manchester (2017).

first reported. <sup>57</sup> The dramatic development of space asset manufacturing is a testament to the confidence level of the return on the investment.

Today, space asset investment is booming. The Grand View Research Market, a research firm, predicts that the global market will grow to more than $645 billion by 2027.<sup>58</sup> There is both optimism and confidence. For example, in 2021, a small U.K.-based startup called Lacuna Space placed three communications satellites in orbit and two more on the way–with two being the size of a briefcase and the third as big as a shoebox.<sup>59</sup> Like nearly all nanosatellite constellation startups, Lacuna Space needs to deploy dozens more satellites to cover *the entire Earth at all times*. <sup>60</sup> Presently, many customers testing the company's technology can only connect to the satellite two to four times a day. Customers accept this timing limitation. "For applications like monitoring remote infrastructure, such as the penguin cameras, that's often enough,” according to Rob Spurrett, Lacuna Space's chief executive and founder.<sup>61</sup>

Both manufacturers and researchers across the globe are exploring the use of nanosatellites for IoT.

With reduced latency time to milliseconds and lower costs for satellite internet, many innovative and creative approaches use cases are being researched. While the field is still in its infancy, early indicators suggest much promise. As the saying goes, “the sky is the limit.” In this case, rather “deep space” is the limit.<sup>62</sup>

*B. Uses of Nanosatellites*

Nanosatellite constellations are changing earthly endeavors, and thus, the future. The exemplar below provides a creative use of a nanosatellite. What a nanosatellite may not have in terms of 24/7 coverage, it compensates for with lower-cost and “just what is needed”’ functionality. Nanosatellites and IoT devices are being used in Antarctica for penguin tracking; where humans rarely go, but where status updates are routinely needed.

In the shadow of giants like SpaceX, more than a dozen startups are building their own globe-spanning networks of nanosatellites, enabling a new kind of everywhere, all-the-time connectivity for people, animals and assets on Earth. Scientists who track the health of Adélie penguins on the icecovered wastes of Antarctica are managing their cameras from thousands of miles away—via tiny satellites orbiting above our heads… this evolving

<sup>62</sup> Pushing all boundaries, there is even ongoing research exploring if nanosatellites can be ruggedized and used for deep space.

(Oct. 2019), https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8827280 [https://perma.cc/BTD5-B8V2]; Advanced CubeSat antennas for deep space and earth science missions: A review. *IEEE Antennas & Propagation Magazine, 61*(5), 37-46. doi: http://franklin.captechu.edu:2123/10.1109/MAP.2019.2932608 See also https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/174234474/IEEE_Magazine.pdf.

satellite technology… [are the] novel networks of nanosats—aka cubesats. <sup>63</sup>

The director of the Adélie penguin project, the Arriba Initiative, built ruggedized “low-cost cameras to withstand harsh Antarctica conditions” and to store images on SD cards that are collected once a year.<sup>64</sup> The cameras rely on satellite internet data transmission, and not terrestrial internet, to frequently report the camera’s status, such as “low battery, covered in ice, tipped over, etc. to their keepers in London via tiny satellites.”<sup>65</sup>

Similar to tracking penguins in Antarctica, nanosatellites are being explored for the tracking of animals in Africa as part of the Smart Parks project. Currently, an elephant collar is being tested that can track animals into “deserts, forests, and transborder parks between counties in Southern Africa” where “no other wireless” is available.<sup>66</sup> The elephant collar being tested in Malawi has a single battery that is expected to last ten years due to relatively low power needs, combined with the satellite connection.<sup>67</sup> This advancement in IoT is remarkable and reflects why “16 companies are now investing in similar types of satellites networks.”<sup>68</sup>

The global innovation and technological advancement and sophistication are astonishing in that nanosatellites are being explored and are universally enjoying successes. On the cusp of this change is Sky and Space Global. Mr. Meir Moalem of Sky and Space Global is not shy in his quest to “bring affordable mobile services to the world.” His fleet is set to be operational by 2020-2021 and will provide text, voice, and data transfer services to the Earth's equatorial regions–including much of Latin America and Africa. If successful in achieving his vision, he will have a market of up to three billion people. It is this follow-on market-share that is driving investment today.<sup>69</sup>

Space asset manufacturers and investors recognize the impact. "Affordable mobile services are critical for the economic and social development of many developing countries," says Mr. Moalem, who believes his nanosatellites will shake up the space-based communications market.<sup>70</sup> "Our total constellation costs just $150m (£108m). That is less than the cost of a single standard communications satellite. This is what we mean when we talk of a disruptive technology."<sup>71</sup>

Sky and Space Global is just one of several companies with big plans for space right now. “Perhaps the most ambitious is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is aiming to build a huge 4,400-satellite constellation offering global internet coverage. It will be using its own Falcon-9 rockets to launch its fleet and plans to have the network operating by 2024.”<sup>72</sup>

Like other potentially lucrative fields, there is competition. The vision of Remco Timmermans, of Open Cosmos Head of Communications, is to “make space accessible by making space missions simple."<sup>73</sup> Others have this same ambition. The current U.S. investment in space is $350 billion annually and “is expected to increase to more than $1 trillion by 2040.” <sup>74</sup> To be expected, with all these satellites, it is becoming an increasingly crowded space.<sup>75</sup>

Not only is space getting congested, but there is also a growing list of satellite manufacturers and investors now interested in getting in at ground zero. LEO satellites, which have an altitude of 2,000km (1,200 miles) or less above the planet, are less expensive to launch. , For example, Sara Spangelo, the CEO and co-founder of Swarm Technologies, the Mountain View, California based LEO manufacturer, stated it could soon complete the first commercially available nanosatellite constellation. <sup>76</sup> This constellation would enable customers to reach a satellite whenever they choose. Remarkably, Swarm has already launched forty-five satellites, thirty-six for commercial customers and the remainder experimental. The company “expects to launch [thirty-six] more from Florida on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 14, with a total of 164 aloft” by the end of 2021, and 150 of them active.<sup>77</sup> Swarm is keeping costs low by producing satellites that are extra small. Each one is about the size of a “grilled cheese sandwich.” Swarm's satellites communicate in the VHF spectrum—adjacent to but not overlapping the spectrum used by shipboard radio systems—which allows for good signal penetration, even in cities and indoors.<sup>78</sup>

*C. When Were Nanosatellites First Considered for IoT?*

Throughout 2017 to 2019, confidence that nanosatellites could be used for IoT continued to increase. Confidence levels rose each year, as researchers continually validated predictions.

At the 6th International Conference on Mechatronics in 2017, three researchers presented their research focused on leveraging IoT for control

Through an innovative combination of a plug-and-play test platform and software, the UK Harwell-based SME is slashing the time it takes for space missions to be designed and qualified for launch.”) *Interactive Space Simulation for Nanosatellites,* UNITED PRESS INT’L SPACE DAILY (Feb. 22, 2019), https://www.proquest.com/wire-feeds/interactive-space-simulationnanosatellites/docview/2184361136/se-2?accountid=28598 [https://perma.cc/V2HV-XAMC]; *Interactive Space Simulation for Nanosatellites*, THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (Feb. 19, 2019), https://www.esa.int/Applications/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/Interactive_space_simulation_for_nanosatellites [https://perma.cc/C8LV-Z2NP].

and communication of data from space. The researchers concluded an orbit closest to the Earth would be optimal and recommended the LEO.<sup>79</sup>

Affordability of space assets may seem like a paradox due to the inherent exorbitant costs to design, build, launch and maintain a satellite. Nanosatellites, however, can be less costly than terrestrial-based fiber optic cables built for traditional internet. Experts acknowledge that the internet is “expensive” to expand across the globe, especially to lesspopulated areas, as it involves “lay[ing] fiber optic cables and build[ing] cell towers in remote areas.”<sup>80</sup> So widely available satellite-based internet, once envisioned in the 1990s, may no longer be a fantasy in 2021 and beyond, and less risky for investors.<sup>81</sup>

In 2018, Report buyer, a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers, issued a report highlighting the versatility of the emerging nanosatellites’ capabilities and relatively low costs. The report acknowledged “a new niche market dedicated to small satellites” with new players excited about the miniaturized technologies with the wide range of advanced launch technologies.<sup>82</sup> It reads, 

> Nanosatellites and microsatellites have proven to be dynamic for embracing new developments in various sectorssuch as weather information and climatic research, multimedia communications, telephone and television, data distribution, transportation and logistics, navigation, safety, security, and rescue. As these satellites have paved the way for cost-effective earth observation missions along with the development of small launchers and small ground stations connected with cost-effective data distribution methods, industry participants have shifted their focus toward developing nanosatellites and microsatellites.<sup>83</sup>

In 2018, Sky and Space Global reported its successful “critical design review” of 200 nanosatellites called “pearls.” As the world watched, Sky and Space Global then proceeded as it sought to bring internet access to underserved regions of the earth through a nanosatellite constellation . <sup>84</sup>

Then in 2019, three PhD students studying in France, the United States, and Northern Ireland collectively assessed that “[e]xtending the internet of things (IoT) networks to remote areas under extreme conditions or for serving sometimes unpredictable mobile applications has increased the need for satellite technology to provide effective connectivity.”<sup>85</sup>

In summary, researchers now recognize that nanosatellites can, with more research and development, have a variety of functionality and application. In 2021, nanosatellites are being explored, and in some cases are even in development, across multiple industries to include:

- weather information and climatic research,

- resource management and mapping,

- multimedia communications,

- telephone and television,

- data distribution,

- transportation and logistics,

- navigation,

- safety, security, and rescue,

- agriculture,

- defense, and

- land management.

In the following sections, case studies are provided that demonstrate nanosatellite application to agriculture and land management, involving associated IoT devices for connectivity and data transmission.

Wider adoption of nanosatellite technology is coming to the United States. 86 Next is the discussion on developments in France and Spain.
