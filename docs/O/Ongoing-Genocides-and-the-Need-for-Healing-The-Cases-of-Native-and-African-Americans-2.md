## American Genocides
Raphaël Lemkin, who defined the concept of genocide before it became a legal concept, studied several histories as part of his background research.<sup>5</sup> Two of these histories were of Native peoples in the Americas and the actions of European colonists against Africans. His definition of genocide is derived from these and other histories and is intended to describe actions that targeted groups of people, rather than individuals. Genocide is not about acts against individuals or groups of individuals. Lemkin defined genocide as acts against racial, religious, political, and other social groups. Genocide covers acts against group membership —i.e., Jews, Armenians, Bosnians, and Native Americans. According to Lemkin, the objective of genocidal acts is to destroy a group of people, in whole or in part. The UN General Assembly, in its 55th session, adopted Lemkin’s definition of Genocide and list of acts as genocidal crimes. What they added was a clause making genocide a crime if intent could be demonstrated as well. In exploring Lemkin’s guidance, it is not our intent to address the international legal definitions and jurisprudence regarding genocide as a crime; they are addressed elsewhere.<sup>6</sup>

### *Slavery as Genocide*
In interpreting Lemkin, the case for the charge of genocide for slavery in the US is as follows.<sup>7</sup> Africans were forbidden to speak their languages, use their African names, practice their religions, or maintain their native cultures; in effect, they were stripped for their African “national, ethnical, and religious group” identities. This is the destruction of what made them African, and of their culture “as a whole or in part.”<sup>8</sup> Enslaved Africans for generations after their initial arrivals were killed for disobeying or defying their masters, opposing slavery, stealing food, or for running away; this is the first of Lemkin’s genocidal charges. For generations, they were starved, physically exposed by lack of clothing, over-worked, tortured, and raped; this is the second genocidal charge in which survivors were physically and bodily harmed. Before African women were imported, enslaved African men were prevented from forming African families. In effect, measures (were imposed) to prevent births within the group; this is the fourth genocidal charge. Finally, in the fifth genocidal charge, there was forcible transfer of children from their parents and community of origin. Throughout slavery in the US, the children of enslaved Africans were sold as chattel. Slavery could not have been sustained without committing these genocidal acts.

### *Intent among Slavers*
We can even consider Article II of the UN Convention on genocide; it stipulates that the above acts were genocidal and potentially criminal only if it can be shown that the perpetrators acted intentionally—that perpetrators knew the effects of their actions.<sup>9</sup> The fact is: Slavers were very much aware of the outcomes of their activities. The problem with intent in African slavery is that slavers knowledge of the effects of their actions against Africans did not matter. As long as Africans were considered inferior to Europeans, whatever slave-masters did were considered an improvement of Africans’ original condition. Any physical and mental suffering Africans experienced was for their own good and was an outcome of their inferiority—precisely as many White Americans believe today. Enslavers and slave masters did not see their actions as criminal; they were quite the opposite—necessary, moral, and even blessed by God.

Philip Livingston wrote in 1750 that “the slave trade was a way of ‘redeeming an unhappy people from inconceivable misery.’”<sup>10</sup> Gérard Mellier, mayor of Nantes, wrote about the same time, “At bottom, the blacks are naturally inclined to theft, robbery, idleness, and treason. In general, they are suited only to live in servitude and for the work and the agriculture of our colonies.”<sup>11</sup> The intent was clear, and the outcome justified when a slave master found his runaway slave on an 1839 Vicksburg street and shoot him dead. When questioned, the man explained that it was his runaway nigger. This explanation satisfied everyone. The slave master was in his rights to kill his slave under such circumstances as if the slave had been a dog or other escaped animal;<sup>12</sup> there was no difference. African inferiority was a given, so, there was no need to even write about it and dwell on the obvious.

Furthermore, the traumatization of slaves was practiced, refined, and intentional. How to beat, abuse, torture, publicly humiliate, and terrorize slaves to control and motivate them to obey and work were the basis of endless discussion, exchange, consultation, and advisement among slave masters.<sup>13</sup> Managing slaves was an art passed on to new masters and overseers from one generation to the next. Slave masters’ intent regarding their actions toward their slaves was quite clear.

### *Elimination of Native People as Genocide*
There were an estimated two million Native peoples in North America (not including Canada) when Columbus arrived.<sup>14</sup> By 1890, from 150,000 to 237,000 remained, or eight to twelve percent of the 1492 population. By Raphaël Lemkin’s definition, it is virtually self-evident that Native American ethnic groups, in what is now the US, were destroyed “as a whole or in part” after contact with the British and Americans. Denial of Indian genocide is centered in the view that the vast majority of Native Americans died from diseases.<sup>15</sup> According to this narrative, Indian deaths were caused by a regrettable flaw in Indian immunities, a misfortune for which European settlers were not responsible. The fact that European settlers brought diseases to North America is somehow unrelated to Indian deaths, and settlers’ unwelcomed presence and

theft of Indian lands are somehow irrelevant. Today, 345 Native American tribes, nations, and bands survive and are now officially recognized by the US federal government as Native Americans.<sup>16</sup> There are another 229 groups in Alaska and other survivors that are forgotten as Indians and not recognized by either State or Federal governments.<sup>17</sup>

Reviews of the few available tribal histories paint a different picture then death by disease. There was a pattern to Indian genocide. One-by-one, each Native state was defeated <sup>18</sup> militarily; successive Native generations fought and were defeated as well. As settlers became more numerous and stronger militarily, Indians became fewer and weaker militarily. In one Indian nation after the other, resistance eventually collapsed due to the death toll from violence. Then, survivors were displaced from their ancestral lands, which had sustained them for generations. Once survivors were sufficiently impoverished, disorganized, and defenseless, their remaining villages were burned, and food sources destroyed. In the final stage of elimination, they were hunted, killed for sport, scalped, hung, raped, and abused in whatever way settlers desired. There are virtually no local US histories without a record of Indian massacres.<sup>19</sup> Starting in 1830, surviving Native people, mostly Cherokee, in the Eastern US were ordered by President Andrew Jackson to march up to two thousand miles and to cross the Mississippi River to settle in Oklahoma. Thousands died on the Trail of Tears.<sup>20</sup> This pattern of defeat, displacement, and victimization repeated itself in the American West.

From this history, Native Americans were victims of all five Lemkin specified genocidal acts.<sup>21</sup> Members of each group were killed not as individuals, but because they were Indians (act one). Once they could no longer resist, serious bodily and mental harm was done to survivors (act two). Once they were confined to reservations, they were made dependent on the Bureau of Indian Affairs for food, housing, education, and healthcare. The Bureau’s neglect inflicted on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part (act three). There was the forcible transfer of children away from their parents and community of origin; Indian children were taken from their families and put in Indian Schools to destroy their culture and identities as Indians <sup>22</sup> (act five).

*Intent against Indians*
As with slavery, there are case-by-case narratives of settler statements and government records of contact with Native peoples that made three things clear. Settlers and colonial, municipal, state, and federal governments wanted Native lands, and Indians did not give up their land without a fight. Peace for settlers and unchallenged access to Native land required eliminating the Native presence. There is no need to go far to find knowledge of this murderous intent. One can start with US Presidents. The third President of the US, Thomas Jefferson, said, “If ever we are constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe, we will never lay it down till that tribe is exterminated, or driven beyond the Mississippi… in war, they will kill some of us; we shall destroy them all.”<sup>23</sup> President Andrew Jackson in ordering the trail of tears, said:

> My original convictions upon this subject have been confirmed by the course of events for several years, and experience is every day adding to their strength. That those tribes cannot exist surrounded by our settlements and in continual contact with our citizens is certain. They have neither the intelligence, the industry, the moral habits, nor the desire of improvement, which are essential to any favorable change in their condition. Established in the midst of another and a superior race, and without appreciating the causes of their inferiority or seeking to control them, they must necessarily yield to the force of circumstances and ere long disappear.<sup>24</sup>

From the 1860s through 1900, the popular mantra for killing Indians, attributed to General Philip Sheridan who fought Indians after the Civil War, was “the only good Indian is a dead Indian”<sup>25</sup> —an often-repeated statement well into the last century. There is virtually no evidence that most Native peoples died due to diseases, leaving vast tracks of North America open to unfettered settler access.

After meeting Raphaël Lemkin’s criteria for genocide, slavery, and the elimination of Native peoples in the US also meet social science or structural criteria for genocide that reiterate the same acts. These include definitions by Pieter Drost, Irving Louis Horowitz, Henry Hutterbach, Steven Katz, Helen Fein, Frank Chalk, and Kurt Jonassohn, Jennifer Balint, and Israel Charny.<sup>26</sup>

What makes the enslavement of Africans and the elimination of Native people in the Western Hemisphere distinct from other modern genocides is the enormity of both potential acts. The number of people killed and displaced, and the number of cultures destroyed on two continents are unprecedented. Genocidal acts in both cases went on for over four hundred years. These long-term genocides meant that Africans and Native people experienced numerous genocidal acts over generations. Furthermore, this long genocidal period since the 1500s led to a unique development among European settlers who executed these acts and needed to justify them—the belief that Europeans were culturally and biological superior (racism) to Africans and other people of color.<sup>27</sup> The American version of racism that framed slavery in the American South and the elimination of Native people is today influential worldwide.<sup>28</sup> The racist legacy of slavery and Native elimination make these genocides effectively open-ended psychological and cultural phenomena—they have not ended.
