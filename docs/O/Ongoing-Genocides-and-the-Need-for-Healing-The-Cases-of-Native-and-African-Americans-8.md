## Summary and Conclusion
Slavery were acts of genocide, as was the elimination of Native peoples in the US. Both genocides meet Raphaël Lemkin and other social scientists’ definitions of genocide. If pursued legally, both histories might also fulfill the UN Convention on Genocide’s definition. However, a unique feature of both genocides is not addressed in any of the current genocide definitions. That is: Neither genocide ended. Slavery and the murder of Native people have been outlawed, yet the psychology and cultural basis for both genocides continue. After centuries, the belief in white racial supremacy (racism) has become embedded in American culture.

Acknowledging US genocides would mean accepting the psychological and cultural damage done to African and Native Americans. It would also mean that the nation must acknowledging the tolls that continuing racism is taking on both and has an obligation to do something about it. Healing individual African and Native Americans is possible. Counseling and various psychological therapies can work, providing that historical trauma and grief are dealt with in their communities as well. African and Native Americans’ psychological problems have origins in culture and history rather than just in personality and individual experiences. However, for individual healing, one must learn to deal effectively with ongoing racism. Ultimately, lasting reconciliation of the American genocides will require lessening both institutional and cultural racisms. Such an effort should be undertaken best at the county and state levels rather than at the federal. If a few descendants of slaves and slave owners and Native Americans and the settlers met and eventually reconciled, it would be a powerful

contradiction of cultural racism. It would also negate continued justifications of racism among Americans whose fore parents played no direct role in either genocide, but who unwittingly defend racism.

A lesson learned from World War II is that unacknowledged and unreconciled genocides are sources of future national and international conflicts and genocides. If this lesson is ignored, then unresolved genocides against enslaved Africans and Native people in the US are one of the most important unfinished businesses of the UN Convention on Genocide. The US is not exempt from the necessity to confront its genocidal history.
