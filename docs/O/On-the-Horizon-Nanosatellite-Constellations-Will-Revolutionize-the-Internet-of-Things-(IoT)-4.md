## IV. CASE STUDIES: FRANCE AND SPAIN NANOSATELLITES
Lessons can be learned by leading companies in two other countries: both France and Spain have supported the expanded use and exploration of nanosatellites.

*A. FRANCE: ANGELS Program*

In Toulouse, France, in May 2017, the French government space agency, the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES), announced a new space joint venture with “Thales Alenia Space.”<sup>87</sup> It was a significant announcement for France, as well as the industrial partners. Thales Alenia Space was to be the supplier of the Argos Neo instrument, which would

be part of the nanosatellite demonstrator Argos Neo on a Generic Economical and Light Satellite (ANGELS) program. <sup>88</sup> Thales Alenia Space had an additional development partner for Argos Neo, Syrlinks, a well-respected manufacturer of radio-communications and geo-location equipment.<sup>89</sup> This team of talented mission partners was rounded out with the addition of the satellite manufacturer Nexeya, based in Toulouse, France. <sup>90</sup> The support is a clear signal that France will invest in French space companies, which will drive down risk. <sup>91</sup>

There was much excitement in 2017 as many saw ANGELS as the dawn of a new era, ANGELS was literally launched just three years after its press conference. <sup>92</sup> Overall, ANGELS was swiftly designed, developed, and manufactured, and weighed less than 50 kg.<sup>93</sup> 2020 was a notable year with the newest innovation of space-borne IoT.<sup>94</sup> Ten times smaller than its predecessors, ANGELS was designed for low cost. <sup>95</sup> ANGELS overcame challenges and achieved miniaturization with highend performance, and now this “technological wonder” is increasing access to internet connectivity.<sup>96</sup>

The French Government had both the foresight and desire to achieve its national objectives in space through partnership. It began in

<sup>89</sup> *Id*. (stating that “ANGELS gives a first taste of the opportunities provided by Kineis, the first constellation of European nanosatellites dedicated to IoT. Carrying a state-of-the-art ARGOS instrument, ANGELS is the operational proof of the success of the French nanosatellite sector.”). Caroline Laurent, CNES's Director of Orbital Systems stated that the opening of new services and the inclusion of ANGELS in the ARGOS satellite fleet represent a new milestone in the ARGOS system success story, and that it was due to the unique partnership between CNES, Thales Alenia Space, Syrlinks and HEMERIA. *Id*.

<sup>91</sup> CNES in French is “Centre national d'études spatiales.” The French government space agency, CNES, manages space assets with either industrial or a commercial purpose. While its headquarters are in Paris, it operates the Toulouse Space Center and Guiani Space Center where it can service both French sand other nation’s satellite launches. *See CNES – The French Space Agency,* THE MISSION FOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (last visited Oct 20, 2021), https://france-science.com/en/cnes-2/ [https://perma.cc/LD73-7NQ3].

<sup>93</sup> Details were carefully considered, and Angels is carrying ARGOS Neo which was the precursor of a new generation of low-cost, highly miniaturized instruments. Earth Observatory Portal, *supra* note 88. (adding that “All the innovations developed on board of the satellite in orbit has immediate benefits for users. In practical terms, this new instrument allows the transmitters to become smaller and lighter, which opens up the range of objects inside which they can be fitted. While the ANGELS model already offers exceptional performance, the 25 similar nanosatellites of the future constellation will meet even more demanding specifications.”).

<sup>95</sup> *See id.* (stating that “[t]echnology offering a five-time performance increase and greater service capability ANGELS is so sensitive that transmitters on the ground can reach it with a transmission power of just 100 mW, about a fifth of the power needed by current ARGOS transmitters. It also provides access to a new frequency band, boosting the capabilities of the seven satellites in the current system. These major innovations will enable users to extend the battery life of their transmitters and reduce their size and weight. Data from the 20,000 transmitters are currently processed by the whole system, a figure that will increase to several million by 2030. For biologists, who have been using the ARGOS system with CLS for more than 40 years, this means that their studies can last longer and can include new, smaller species through suitably miniaturized transmitters.”).

<sup>96</sup> *Id*. (stating that the addition of ANGELS to the ARGOS satellite fleet “offers new data collection capabilities. The ARGOS Neo instrument is the first of a new generation: this technological wonder has passed the challenge of miniaturization by being ten times lighter (2 kg) and three times more energyefficient than previous generations.”).

2018 when the French space agency CNES created an investment fund of “80 to 100 million euros ($95 to $119 million).” <sup>97</sup> The French Government’s announcement is revealing: “We completely changed our approach, and we consider CNES has a very important role to play in NewSpace.” <sup>98</sup> These efforts to achieve France’s vision have placed France on the international stage as a world leader in space.

*B. SPAIN: SATELIOT Partnership*
“Spain has had success in nanosatellite innovation and IoT.” <sup>99</sup> The Government of Spain wanted to be an early adopter and boost their economy, and satellite internet became a key component of the country’s business economic development. The COVID-19 pandemic reemphasized to Spain that satellite internet would and could play a major role to jump start businesses. <sup>100</sup> Spanish satellite manufacturer, Hispasat, and its CEO said, “any investment in the satellite industry is a contribution to growth, job creation, innovation and competition within industry.”<sup>101</sup> Spain's mountainous landscape makes land-based internet more challenging. <sup>102</sup> Also, Spain is seeking to accelerate the development of 5G with a high-quality internet combining the technologies of terrestrial internet, fiber optic, and satellites. Thus, Spain made the natural choice to invest in nanosatellite innovation for IoT.

Spain’s Space Agency, Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial (INTA), is working on Sateliot, one of the country’s leading satellite telecommunications operators in Spain. On December 2, 2020, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) granted to Sateliot approval to launch a constellation of 100 nanosatellites for IoT connectivity. <sup>103</sup> Spain is proud that Sateliot will be the first satellite telecommunications operator to provide global and continuous connectivity to the universe of IoT under the 5G protocol. Space-based internet will soon connect to automobiles and homes. <sup>104</sup>

The combination of terrestrial-based internet and space-based internet is transformational.<sup>105</sup> Sateliot’s nanosatellite constellation at low altitudes acts “as mobile towers in space” and increases “connectivity for the IoT beyond the limits of terrestrial infrastructure”.<sup>106</sup>

The design, manufacturing, assembly, launching, and servicing of nanosatellite constellations takes a village. In the case of Spain, it took three countries collaborating and international approval. Sateliot is based in Barcelona, Spain, partnered with Open Cosmos, a U.K. company that operates end-to-end space missions. Open Cosmos was responsible for the design and manufacturing, Harwell Technology in the U.K. handled assembly, and Kazakhstan performed viability testing in its country’s test areas. <sup>107</sup> Open Cosmos oversaw the launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan by integrating Sateliot’s nanosatellite into the deployer launched by the Soyuz rocket. <sup>108</sup> Space technology is rocket science, and Spain benefited from collaboration due to the wide-range of expertise and sub-specialties needed for success.

With Spain’s interest to learn from Sateliot’s early successes, it can be on the path to the world stage in space innovation.

*C. Review of Case Studies*
Spain and France have demonstrated the viability and the profitability of nanosatellite constellations for IoT. Additionally, both governments provided regulatory approval, which is essential in minimizing risks and increasing profitability.

These case studies demonstrate a potential for other countries to be leaders in space innovation and technology with the proper support. This course of action will make Spain a new contender in space power and non-terrestrial IoT networks. <sup>109</sup> The utility of non-terrestrial IoT networks knows almost no bounds. <sup>110</sup>

With these opportunities, Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite internet will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040.<sup>111</sup> While satellite launchings, even nanosatellites, are

<sup>108</sup> *Id*. (stating that this nanosatellite referred to as 3B5GSAT will be “the first of three with which Sateliot will test the IoT service with 5G coverage – comprises an innovative small technology – smaller than a microwave and weighing no more than 10 kg – made up of 10x10x10 cm cubes whose standards are adapted to the function to be performed. Moreover, unlike large geostationary satellites that are almost 36,000 kilometres high, it will be in a low orbit, flying at only about 500 kilometres to ensure global IoT connectivity. It will travel at a speed of about 7 km per second, circling the Earth once every 90 minutes.”).
