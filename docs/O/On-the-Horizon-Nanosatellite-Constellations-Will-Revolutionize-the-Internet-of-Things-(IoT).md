### On the Horizon: Nanosatellite Constellations Will Revolutionize the Internet of Things (IoT)
{: .no_toc}
*Diane M. Janosek, Esq.*<sup>*</sup>

The Internet of Things (IoT) has experienced exponential growth and use across the globe with 25.1 billion devices currently in use.<sup>1</sup> Until recently, the functionality of the IoT was dependent on secure data flow between internet terrestrial stations and the IoT devices. Now, a new alternative path of data flow is on the horizon. IoT device manufacturers are now looking to outer space nanosatellite constellations to connect to a different type of internet. This new type of internet is no longer terrestrial with fiber cables six feet underground. It is now looking up, literally, 200 to 300 miles above the earth, to communicate, connect, and transmit data. Remarkably innovative, nanosatellites are the opposite of typical or historically sizable satellites. Nanosatellites are quite small, sometimes just the size of a shoebox. These extremely small satellites are rugged enough to remain in orbit for two to five years, all while communicating ubiquitously back to earth. These low-cost solutions to space technologies are now seen as a viable alternative to traditional terrestrial-based internet for IoT’s device needs.

These low-cost satellites have significant benefits. For one, they have lowered the barrier to entry. Also, due to their design for purpose, functionality of nanosatellites can be tailored to purchasers’ needs as part of the design process, from more sophisticated kitchen appliances to tracking safari animals. Tailoring generally results in a higher-thanaverage return on investment, thus making tailored satellites more attractive to both investors and industry alike.

Many companies across multiple countries recognize the value of nanosatellites. France and Spain are ahead of the curve for space based IoT device connectivity. With this new technology, the investment in the field of nanosatellites has exploded. The current U.S. commercial and defense investment in space, in all orbits, is $350 billion annually, and it is expected to grow to $1 trillion or more by 2040.<sup>2</sup> This article will reveal that innovation in space technology has accelerated investments in space by multiple countries, investors, and industry. Likewise, there is a growth of IoT devices in the United States with more devices being purchased, more functionality per device, and better transmission. These approaches seek to satisfy the exponential demand for data, secure transmission, and global internet access, and this article will address why there is an increasing demand.

Indeed, a new era of data flow to and from “things” may quite well result in a “satellite network of things” in place of an IoT in the near future. Countries are realizing data transmission may best be from space, or at least optimized when combined with terrestrial internet communications. Using nanosatellite constellations to satisfy this demand is transformational. Nations are all reaching this same conclusion and reckoning that space is truly the next frontier that can change one’s trajectory to world domination in space and economic prosperity. Both France and Spain have invested in this new arena with the use of nanosatellite constellations imminent for IoT devices, while the United States is poised to learn from their experience approach. Without a doubt, the U.S. world leadership position will be further solidified if it supports and promotes, as part of its research and development, its nanosatellites.

Nanosatellite constellations are the future of IoT as early concepts are now in research, development, and now production. This is the space, literally outer space, to watch.
