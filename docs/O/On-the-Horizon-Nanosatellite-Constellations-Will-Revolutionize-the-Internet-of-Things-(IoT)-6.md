## VI. CONCLUSION: PROMOTE THE EXPANSION OF NANOSATELLITES
Innovation in space technology has accelerated investments in space by multiple countries, investors, and industries. A review of the growth of IoT devices in the U.S. reveals a voracious appetite for more devices, more functionality, and increased data transmission options. These approaches partially satisfy the exponential demand for data, secure transmission, and global internet access. France and Spain serve as examples of success.

Countries are realizing data transmission may best be from space, or at least optimized when combined with terrestrial internet communications. Using nanosatellite constellations to satisfy this demand is transformational. Nations are all reaching this same conclusion and understanding that space is truly the next frontier that can change one’s trajectory to world domination and economic prosperity. Without a doubt, the U.S. world leadership position will be further solidified if, as part of its research and development, its nanosatellites also address cybersecurity and surveillance vulnerabilities.<sup>121</sup>

Do not wait for the horizon to get here: now is the time to prepare for the next big thing in secure digital global communications.
