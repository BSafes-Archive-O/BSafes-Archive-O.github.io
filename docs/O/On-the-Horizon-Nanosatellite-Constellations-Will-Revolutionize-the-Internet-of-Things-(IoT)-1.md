## I. INTRODUCTION
The IoT industry is booming with 25.1 billion internet connected devices in the world, and this number does not include mobile telephones.<sup>3</sup> According to Gartner’s research, the volume of IoT devices in global use is expected to grow by 17% to 31% annually for the next ten years. <sup>4</sup>

At the same time, the growth of IoT has driven the increased utilization of space assets to control and monitor IoT devices. The emergence of ubiquity, having satellites in orbit and being “everywhere,” has accompanied this dramatic investment in the commercialization of

Specific estimates in the 2019 report are: “Utilities will be the highest user of IoT endpoints, totaling 1.17 billion endpoints in 2019, and increasing 17% in 2020 to reach 1.37 billion endpoints. ‘Electricity smart metering, both residential and commercial will boost the adoption of IoT among utilities [....]’” *Id*. The report also notes that building automation will have the largest growth rate in 2020 by 42%. *Id*.

space. <sup>5</sup> This expansion and innovation in commercial space has opened the door for IoT to increase their footprint where terrestrial internet does not exist. With affordable and accessible launch vehicles for smaller satellites, IoT can truly explore previously closed doors. The technological innovation of smaller satellites, launch access, and tailored functionality, offer much promise in the new world of the IoT.

There are now options for IoT devices to connect to the internet, a company’s intranet, cloud services providers, and/or dedicated networks derived from dedicated satellites. Because of the relative affordability of having a dedicated network from dedicated satellites, the production and sales of nanosatellites to global customers, including IoT manufacturers, has grown exponentially. <sup>6</sup> Like IoT devices, nanosatellites have unparalleled functionality and can be tailored from the ground for a very narrow purpose. So yes, these devices are in high demand, and are taking on many of the functions heretofore performed solely by the internet, which begs two questions: whether IoT regulation requiring cybersecurity protocols should be expanded to nanosatellite IoT use, and whether IoT devices residing on satellite communications will make data transmission more secure. As there is no current consensus, the world is watching, especially industry, how this evolves. Each country may approach it differently in terms of regulation. So, watch this space!

Significant benefits arise from the low cost of nanosatellites, beginning with a lower barrier to entry into the IoT device marketplace and the potential profit with expanded sale of IoT devices in rural areas where there is no terrestrial internet. With functionality tailored to the IoT manufacturers’ needs, the return on the investment is higher, and many companies across multiple countries are recognizing the value of nanosatellites. The field is now exploding.<sup>7</sup>

By avoiding terrestrial connections, subject to known cyber vulnerabilities and hacking exploitations, will smaller satellites, which avoid the initial terrestrial internet make data traffic more secure?<sup>8</sup> If so, will the “Internet of Things” become known as the “Satellite Array of Things” and be preferred by manufacturers and consumers alike? How powerful could this new paradigm be if cybersecurity is sustained or increased, especially if the United States seizes the temporal opportunity to take the global lead?
