## Introduction
In March of 2020, campus life came to an abrupt halt while the COVID-19 pandemic took hold globally. As university faculty, we made an unexpected shift from in-person, on-campus teacher education classes into online, off-campus experiences. This abrupt shift raised anxieties, leaving us all searching for ways to adapt activities, engage students, and present content in innovative ways. 

The nature of our work in teacher education came to the forefront. Teacher education consists of a duality between presentation of theory and research and the modeling of pedagogical strategy. The teacher educator explicitly uses the act of teaching to simulate the methods of teaching; such practices focus not only on delivering and discovering content but also in showing what that content looks like in classrooms. For many, conducting class online was especially challenging because modeling pedagogical strategies felt impossible without the four walls of the classroom. We have spent the previous decades ranting about the importance of preparing teachers for the twenty-first century student and seamless engagement with online platforms was baked into the narrative. We felt the weight of this responsibility and with it came the need to look into our own knowledge, skills, and comfort in working in a high-tech environment. The demand was to “address the challenge while […] in the act of working on it” (Wagner, as cited in Drago-Severson, 2016, p.39). We were living in surreal times. 

Furthermore, around this time, Critical Race Theory (CRT) came under fire. CRT views the structures within which we work from the perspective of the interaction between race, racism and power (Delgado & Stefancic, 2001). As teacher educators in a Teachers of English Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) program, we felt confused about the increased attacks on CRT, which was the underpinning of all of our work. We were in the eye of the storm, subsequent to conservative media attacks and the misportrayal of CRT (Hess, 2021). The context made the teaching of criticality challenging due to the polarization of the matter. And for the first time we saw images of parents protesting about CRT in front of schools. The impact, in particular for us, was frontal. We work with teachers who teach racialized, ethnically and linguistically diverse student populations. These populations are on the rise, yet schools are failing them as evidenced by lower achievement outcomes (National Center for Education Statistics, 2017; Sanchez, 2017). We were now feeling and clearly seeing what Zinn (2014) has said: teaching is an entirely political act.

While we were bearing the brunt of the moment, other faculty were eager for a return to “normal.” This was audible in the form of questions about when we would return to face-to-face classes and in comments about the stress of the moment. Minor (2021) reminds us that “[a]s soon as the pandemic hit, there [was] this really toxic discourse about, ‘When are we going to get back to normal?’” (Minor, C. as cited in Ehrenhalt, p. 48). For us, this was not an option. We could see how the pandemic was disproportionately affecting the racially, culturally, and linguistically diverse K-12 learners, children that our students would be or were already teaching. These events and our positions as untenured faculty challenged and shook us. From this position, we knew that our interventions in faculty meetings had to be measured against the reality of our professional futures. 

Additionally, we felt concerned that an opportunity to revisit our pedagogy and practices would be wasted. Certain “that normal we left behind left far too many people at the margins” (Minor, C. as cited in Ehrenhalt, 2021, p. 48), we saw disruption as a needed opportunity in our field. We considered the pandemic a disaster that afforded us the opportunity to question and redesign a new normal. Instructors around the globe shared in the shift to online teaching. During the pandemic, 91% of universities around the world transitioned to online teaching (Oliveira et al., 2021). Prior to this emergency, however, higher education that focused on “classroom interactions solely [was] becoming outdated” (Oliveira et al., 2021, p. 359). Change was already needed prior to the pandemic. 

Our mission to develop critical teachers who challenge hegemonic power imbalances in school and society which marginalize non-dominant racialized, cultural, and linguistic students and families further underscored this need for change.  The intent of teacher education “has been to support novices to develop a vision of high-quality teaching that is content-rich, rigorous, and meaningful to students, and which novices can enact in their classrooms” (McDonald, Kazemi, & Schneider Kavanagh, 2013, p. 379) yet, despite this intent, teacher education has failed to create teachers who can fully operationalize critical practices (Burciaga & Kohli, 2018) that challenge hegemonic positions and lead to teacher advocates that are socially justice-minded. Thus, prior to the pandemic, additional research into teacher educator pedagogy was already past due. Becoming online practitioners forced us to abandon customary routines and practices and renegotiate why and how we do what we do. 

Immediately, we took the opportunity to look within and conduct analysis of how our perceptions changed and opened the space to reconsider, question and reflect on our assumptions and practices about in-person versus online teaching and teacher education. This focus on adult development, and our own development, within the realm of teacher education, was essential as a correlation between educator learning and improved student learning outcomes exists (Drago-Severson, 2009, p. 7). Online study became the reality so our pedagogical approaches should purposefully and critically adapt. In the consideration of returning to “normal,” we seek additional discussion of how to innovate towards a better normal through this study. Though CRT and fostering justice-oriented teachers are essential requirements of our work, the focus of this study is not how we are grounded in CRT or how we develop socially-minded teach ers; instead, our purpose is critical self-analysis of our teaching trajectory, during this very particular moment, to consider
ongoing pedagogical improvement. 

### Research Questions

The central questions guiding this research are:
- In what ways have our perceptions changed in terms of face-to-face versus online teaching and learning?
- What are our perceptions about student engagement and achievement?
- What are our perceptions about how our professional positionality is altered in online teaching?
- What learning can we take with us should we return to face-to-face teaching?

### Theoretical Framework   
 
Following Kolb and Kolb (2005), we understand learning as a process which requires reflection on concrete experience.  Thus,  
 
>> all learning is relearning. Learning is best facilitated by a process that draws out students’ beliefs and ideas about a topic, so that they can be examined, tested, and integrated with the new, more refined ideas. (Kolb & Kolb, 2005, p. 194).  
 
Because adults bring more established and varied experiences and knowledge to new learning, and because we were reflecting not only on the learning of the adult students in our courses but also on our own ability to adapt in changing circumstances, this study was guided by adult learning theory. We have viewed our experiences and that of our students from the lens of Adult Constructivist-Developmental (ACD) Theory as first conceptualized by Kegan (1982; 2018) and extended to include collegial inquiry by Drago-Severson (2009). We explore ACD and describe how collegial inquiry guided this study.  
Kegan notes that ACD considers “adult meaning making [as] a relational theory that places the thinking and acting person within a complex context” (Stewart & Wolodko, 2016, p. 248). A constructivist theory of learning must first attend to learner epistemologies; ACD posits that adults not only change our meanings but also the very form by which we are making our meanings (Kegan, 2018). Thus, ACD considers not only diverse ways of knowing but also changing ways of knowing as development occurs. To better understand this distinction, a closer look at the three specific tenets of Kegan’s ACD, constructivism, developmentalism, and the subject-object balance is essential.

### Constructivism

Constructivism posits that we make meaning from our lived experiences (Drago-Severson, 2016) and “build a self through interpersonal pathways” (Stewart & Wolodko, 2016, p. 248). According to Chang (2021), “people construct knowledge from activities and reflections rather than passively absorbing information” (p. 7), and constructivism builds from the premise that meaning making, and therefore knowledge construction, happens dynamically in the negotiation of lived experiences and new interactions, thus allowing the “complex context” (Stewart & Wolodko, 2016, p. 248) of individual identities and experiences to factor into ways of knowing.

### Developmentalism

ACD is also founded on the notion of developmentalism, which recognizes that adult growth is possible (Drago-Serverson, 2016) and offers “hopeful principles about how to support adult growth so we can better manage the complexities of 21st century life” (Drago-Severson, 2009, p. 33). Adults need to adapt to changing circumstances (Kegan, 2018) and that developmental theory must account for the dynamics of “relationships to authority, responsibility, ambiguity and complexity” (Drago-Severson, 2009, p. 33). Developmentalism posits that adults progress through various stages of mental complexity, each with a unique way of knowing which stage affects approaches to incorporating new knowledge; these include the instrumental mind, the socializing mind, the self-authoring mind, and the self-transforming mind (Kegan, 1982). When approaching learning from an instrumental way of knowing, adults tend to treat learning transactionally; the instrumental knower has a “what do you have that can help me” (Steward and Wolodko, 2016, p. 68) approach to knowledge creation. Accordingly, learning is about the “stor[ing] and process[ing] of information” (Stewart & Wolodko, 2016, p. 250) with a focus on the “right” answer in a given situation (Drago-Severson, 2016; Stewart & Wolodko, 2016).  Instrumental knowers seek learning contexts which provide them with information and a sense that a clear right and wrong answer exists.

In contrast, adults who learn from a socializing way of knowing have a more developed ability to think in psychologically abstract ways (Stewart & Wolodko, 2016), but they remain “other-focused…[and] often subordinate their needs to the needs of others” (Drago-Severson, 2016, p. 68). Socializing minds are “strongly influenced by the opinions and expectations of the social milieu and culture” (Stewart & Wolodko, 2016, p. 251), so they may feel compelled to align themselves with dominant norms of their learning contexts and communities. Socializing knowers will benefit from learning contexts which help them navigate collaboration with others to find their own voices so as to resist the urge to succumb to peer norms (Stewart & Wolodko, 2016).

Where socializing knowers require support developing their voices, self-authoring knowers are reflective enough about themselves and their contexts to recognize how their ways of knowing may differ from perceived norms (Stewart & Wolodko, 2016). The self-authoring knower “[has] developed the capacity to generate their own value systems and long-term purposes” (Drago-Severson, 2016, p. 68). Despite this reflective state, self-authoring knowers “struggle with transforming their deeply held personal frames of reference or mindsets to make sense of new experience” (Stewart & Wolodko, 2016, p. 251). In contrast, the self-transforming mind is one that can see their own cultural lens and the effect of their lived experiences on their knowing (Stewart & Wolodko, 2016). These learners will naturally focus their attention on a more broad understanding of their overall learningand will benefit from learning contexts which allow them choice and agency (Stewart & Wolodko, 2016). Advancing adult development requires that learning is facilitated with scaffolds that consider that adult learners may be at any of these different epistemological places (Drago-Severson, 2016).

### The Subject-Object Balance
As adults make epistemological shifts, there is an accompanying shift in the subject-object balance (Kegan, 1982; Kegan, 2018; Drago-Severson, 2009). This subject-object balance, which is an adult’s ability to reflect on themselves, is the third tenet of ACD. More specifically, this notion reflects “the relationship between what we can take a perspective on (hold as ‘object’) and what we are embedded in and cannot see or be responsible for (are ‘subject to’)” (Drago-Severson, 2009, p.  37). Thus, as adults’ ways of knowing become more reflexive, so expands their ability to see more as objects. This expanding worldview is the focus of our work as teacher educators, but also as we consider our own learning.

### Collegial Inquiry 

To consider our own learning, we rely on Drago-Severson’s (2009; 2016) extension of ACD to include collegial inquiry, which “involves purposefully reflecting on one’s own assumptions with one or more partners to further stretch one’s seeing, thinking, and feelings” (Drago-Severson, 2016, p. 77). However, collaboration of this sort requires trust among collaborators (Drago-Severson, 2009); in related research, Sverdup and Schei (2015) suggest that genuine collaboration requires a sense of psychological safety. When these conditions are established, engaging in reflective practice with peers can “help us to develop a deeper understanding of our assumptions on our thoughts and actions” (Drago-Severson, 2009, p. 157). This notion of collegial inquiry has guided our process.
