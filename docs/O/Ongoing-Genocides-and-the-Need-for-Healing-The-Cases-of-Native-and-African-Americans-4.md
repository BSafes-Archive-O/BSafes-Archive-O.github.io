## Toward Reconciliation and Healing
Three closely related steps can be taken to move the US toward reconciliation and healing.<sup>37</sup> First, individuals can be healed while structural change is sought. The second step is for institutional reform. However, a lesson learned from decades of domestic efforts is that improvements in individual and institution outcomes cannot be sustained without also challenging the cultural beliefs that reinforce institutional practices and individual disdain for others. So, in the US, the third step requires addressing racism at its cultural core. We <sup>38</sup> hypothesize that through simultaneous efforts to reduce both institutional and cultural racism, a point can be reached where some real acknowledgment of the damage done by African and Native American genocides will be possible.
