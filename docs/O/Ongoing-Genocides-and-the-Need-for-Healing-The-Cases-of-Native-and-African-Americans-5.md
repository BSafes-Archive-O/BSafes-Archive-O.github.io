## 1. Healing Individuals
### *Counseling Native Americans*
In response to high rates of suicide, homicide, alcoholism, domestic violence, and child abuse, psychological counseling has been provided to Native people in a variety of settings— communities, prisons, schools, and individually. To date, these treatment outcomes have been disappointing.<sup>39</sup> The problem is that Western-based therapeutic approaches presume the patients' psychological problems are individual in origin and can be addressed as such. However, there is increasing recognition among therapists that patient-centered approaches ignore the historical and social causes of psychological dysfunction among Native peoples. Brave Heart et al. and Duran et al. have brought attention to the role of culturally embedded historical trauma (HT) in alcohol and other drug use among Native peoples in the US and Canada.<sup>40</sup> Gone re-frames current Native American distress to the intergenerational effects of massive group oppression.<sup>41</sup> In effect, individual drug and alcohol use are enduring outcomes of HT.

Native People suffer from historically unresolved grief as well as trauma. The specifics of lost relatives, land, culture, and identity are well known to Indian people. Psychological interventions to address Native people’s unresolved grief and trauma must include American Indian approaches to address cultural damage. Duran et al. propose addressing the impact of HT through religious and family ceremonies, which explicitly link current functioning to the sequelae of HT.<sup>42</sup> Evidence is provided for the effectiveness of such approaches. Brave Heart et al. describe healing the “soul wound” with psycho-educational group interventions.<sup>43</sup> Gone describes a community-based intervention for healing HT.<sup>44</sup> A review of such interventions in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand by Gameon and

Skewes describes ten interventions using Native people's community-based approaches.<sup>45</sup> However, the drawback to individual psychological and cultural therapies is that they cannot stop ongoing psychological assaults from racial discrimination and social rejection derived from racism. These therapeutic efforts address damage only to individuals.

### *Counseling African Americans*
The intergenerational transmission of HT among African-Americans has received scant attention among US health researchers.<sup>46</sup> What has been found are links between current racial discrimination and substance use and abuse among African-American youth.<sup>47</sup> With controls for education and income, those who report experiencing racial discrimination were found to have 3.31 higher odds of elevated drug use. Clark found experiencing racial bias is linked to depressive symptoms and substance use among African Americans and African Caribbean 18 to 35-year-olds. Metzger et al.<sup>48</sup> found that the stress associated with racial discrimination was linked to alcohol use and binge drinking. Carliner et al.<sup>49</sup> found that perceived racial discrimination correlates to a 2.32 higher risk of illicit drug use among a sample of 6,587 African-American adults. Each outcome is an effect of current racial discrimination.<sup>50</sup> None of these outcomes have been linked to HT.

However, perceived racial discrimination does not explain black-on-black violence, low evaluation of personal worth, self and other hatred, domestic violence, and depression. Nor does racial discrimination explain beating and traumatizing children to compel obedience, and frequent reference to one another as “niggers” and to African American women as “bitches.”<sup>51</sup> Also, there is active denial and unconscious shame over having gone through slavery, and of being black. These are behaviors where HT can be demonstrated.<sup>52</sup> Furthermore, over 4,000 lynchings during Jim Crow (1890–1960) reinforced HT from slavery and led to the first petition to the UN for relief from genocide.<sup>53</sup> Since then, police, mob, and individual acts of racial violence have only compounded unresolved HT from slavery. Joy DeGruy explains these unaddressed issues among African Americans as a post-traumatic slave syndrome.<sup>54</sup> The syndrome has existed across generations since slavery. It has gone unacknowledged, untreated, unresolved, and denied with tragic consequences.

In African American communities, there is virtually no community-wide psychological treatment. Federal and state community mental health centers and psychotherapy were defunded decades ago.<sup>55</sup> Where treatment exists, outcomes for African Americans are also poor and vary by socioeconomic background.<sup>56</sup> Again, it is assumed that African American patients’  psychological problems are individual in origin and can be addressed as such. As with Native Americans, psychotherapists inadvertently end up trying to treat personal issues that have institutional and cultural roots.

Efforts to develop effective treatments are underway via religious-based African American organizations. The goal is to address intergenerational transmission of HT on current family functioning, attitudes toward self-worth, and interpersonal violence aimed at other African Americans—the cultural transmission of trauma.<sup>57</sup> Such a program is described by Myers and exists in New York City.<sup>58</sup> The Association of Black Psychologists has proposed Emotional Emancipation Circles in partnership with Community Healing Networks as a possibility.<sup>59</sup>

### *Counseling White Americans*
To move the US toward acknowledging its dual genocides requires getting White Americans to understand their role in denying these genocides, and in justifying continued racism. Racism should be included as an antisocial personality disorder or sociopathy in the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).<sup>60</sup> Attempts by Black psychiatrists to have racism addressed as a psychiatric issue have been rebuffed by the white mainstream American Psychiatric Association (APA). The reason for the APA’s opposition to including racism in the DSM is that racism is culturally normative. If racism were included in the DSM, it would be considered sociopathic behavior, which refers to a cluster of symptoms that describes people who, based on environmental influences, display a callous disregard (lack of empathy) towards others. Because of a weakened conscience, they behave recklessly, aggressively, or in a wholly indifferent manner towards the needs and humanity of others, even when they know their behavior is wrong.<sup>61</sup> Racism disposes some Whites to act in this way toward people of color, and to treat them as they would not treat other Whites.

At the individual level, addressing beliefs in white racial supremacy should be integrated into psychotherapy and counseling for White Americans. Exploring historical and unresolved grief and trauma may be an intergenerational issue for White Americans as well. HT and grief may be related in some way to a need for a strong belief in white supremacy. The failure of the APA to address racism and the psychology of white supremacy means the association is unwilling to address one of the fundamental psychiatric and cultural problems of our times. However, even if the DSM was revised to include white supremacy and White Americans were counseled about racism, these measures would be insufficient to eliminate racism in the US. As with Native and African Americans, White psychotherapy will
