## Methodology 

### Qualitative Research Approach 
This qualitative study uses a critical autoethnographic approach, which builds on the tradition of ethnographic research.  Ethnography explores and makes meaning of a “culture-sharing group’s shared patterns of behavior, beliefs, and language that develop over time” (Creswell & Guetterman, 2019). In traditional ethnography, researchers seek objective distance from the culture-sharing group. A major critique of ethnography is this “crisis of representation” (Creswell & Guetterman, 2019, p. 475) through which ethnographers claim authority to interpret a cultural group. In response to this critique, autoethnography, or the systematic analysis of personal experience, “challenges canonical ways of doing research and representing others” (Ellis, Adams, & Bochner, 2011, History of Autoethnography section, para. 1). Autoethnography recognizes the duality of a researcher as both researcher and participant within a culture-sharing group; researchers become the source of emic and etic data (Creswell & Poth, 2018) and offer their positionality and context to help the reader interpret the study. Autoethnography transparently shares the study’s goal of offering truth as it is understood from the perspective of the researcher and not as if it represents a more global or absolute Truth (Creswell & Guetterman, 2019). By refuting the notion of objective truth, autoethnography is “value-centered rather than pretending to be value-free” (Ellis et al., 2011, History of Autoethnography section, para. 3). Because the researcher is woven into the story, the urge to colonize the meaning of a culture-sharing group is diminished and the recognition that the researcher fundamentally affects the research is recognized (Ellis et al., 2011).  

We used a critical autoethnographic approach which focuses on “changing the status quo” (Creswell & Guetterman, 2019, p. 479) and was developed “in response to current society, in which the systems of power, prestige, privilege, and authority serve to marginalized individuals who are from different classes, races, and genders” (Creswell & Poth, 2018, p. 92). Critical autoethnography is a “space for free speech, decolonized inquiry, and advocacy” (Holman Jones, 2021, p. 217) which “seeks a counternarrative to traditional qualitative research that positions the researcher as an omniscient expert” (Tilley-Lubbs, 2018, p.17). We recognize the privilege ascribed to our roles as university professors, yet also seek to explore the nuances of the hierarchies within academia and at the intersection of other aspects of our identities. We seek Freirian praxis (Freire, 2016) through which we engage in a learning dialectic alongside our students, and, as critical autoethnographers of this work, we also recognize that Freire’s “conscientization is a fluid state, one that can only occur when we are willing to constantly confront our power and privilege” (Tilley-Lubbs, 2018, p. 13-14). In critical autoethnography, “theory and story exist in a mutually influential relationship” (Holman Jones, 2016, p. 229) as the researcher uses a theoretical lens to understand and tell the story of their experience within the culture-sharing group.  In this study, we turned to theory, to our inner understandings, and to each other to make sense of our perceptions and experiences. This collective endeavor was conducted when the “world was in the throes of a global pandemic, racial violence, and environmental disaster” (Holman Jones, 2021, p. 217), and this collectivity served as a means for survival and sensemaking. Ellis et al. (2011) note that the co-constructed narratives of a critical autoethnography “illustrate the meanings of relational experiences, particularly how people collectively cope” (Authoethnographic Potentials, Issues, and Criticisms section, para. 9). In preparation for a return to “normal,” we use critical autoethnography to take with us the lessons learned to advocate for an enhanced new normal. 

### Data Collection and Analysis Procedures 
Data for this study was collected and analyzed during the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning with our own journals and recorded meetings at the outset of the pandemic. In addition to capturing our individual experiences through journals and recordings of our discussions with each other, we gathered and reviewed course syllabi, evaluations, final projects, and class recordings for faculty-student and student-student interactions. Transcriptions, journals, and additional data were gathered as a collection of field notes and reviewed separately by each researcher who labeled units of text to “generate an overall cultural interpretation of the group from the analysis” (Creswell & Poth, 2018, p. 95). We, the researchers, then compared the outcome of interpretations, which allowed for a measure of inter-rater reliability at > 87%. This process permitted collaborative sensemaking of our lived experiences. 

The analysis process was ongoing as we consulted research and each other through the Spring of 2020 and, subsequently, the 2020-2021 academic year; this dynamic ethnographic analysis process allowed us to reflect and revise our practices as we navigated changing circumstances. We have pivoted repeatedly through changing circumstances and have gathered what we learned here to promote additional discussion. 

### Validity and Ethical Concerns 
We do not purport a representative truth; rather, we foreground our own identities and professional context for readers to interpret the meaning of this work within their own contexts and applications. Following Boghossian (2006), we recognize a constructivist notion of truth which reflects “the idea that there are multiple perspectives, interpretations and truths, and that each perspective has its own validity” (p. 715). We embrace the recognition in Ellis et al. (2011) that autoethnography “is one of the approaches that acknowledges and accommodates subjectivity, emotionality, and the researcher’s influence on research, rather than hiding from these matters or assuming they don’t exist” (History of Autoethnography section, para. 3). This study contains our collective understanding. 

From an ethical perspective, because autoethnographers are in the research location, protecting the anonymity of our research location and colleagues becomes difficult, and we run the risk of “implicat[ing] others in our work” (Ellis, et al., 2011, Relational Ethics section, para. 1). To protect our colleagues’ privacy, we have not referenced any individual colleagues in an identifiable way, and we have asked peers from our shared research location to review this study for fairness and contextual accuracy. For this study, Researchers 1 and 2 were the only collaborators due to the need for trust and psychological safety within a larger hierarchy. No funding supported this research, and there are no competing interests to declare.
