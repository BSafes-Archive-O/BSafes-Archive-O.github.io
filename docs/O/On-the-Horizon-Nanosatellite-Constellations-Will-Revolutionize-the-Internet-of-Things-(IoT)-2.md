*A. What Is IoT And What Is the New Law on IoT?*
“The IoT is the network of physical objects that contain embedded technology to communicate and sense or interact with their internal states or external environment.” <sup>9</sup> There are thousands of types of IoT devices; a Palo Alto Network report identified 8,355 different “device types.”<sup>10</sup> Examples include:

- Security cameras;
- Printers;
- Conference room tablets;
- Remote property sensors;
- Coffee makers;
- Door bells; and
- Door openers.

While IoT devices have a wide range of potential applications, IoT devices generally do not have a robust capability to protect the data and information being transmitted by the device.<sup>11</sup>

In late 2020, the United States passed its first Internet of Things act entitled “IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act.”<sup>12</sup> The goal of the inaugural federal act in this space is to achieve a more secure U.S. supply chain and manufacturing resiliency, which rests on operational visibility, cyber awareness, and best practices in the areas of safety, auditability, and compliance.<sup>13</sup> This “IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act” aimed to address the protection shortfalls in these devices. Before that could happen, however, the legislators, with industry input, had to distill the existing complex field of IoT into a common description and definition. Merely coming to consensus on one definition was an accomplishment.

The “IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act” defines IoT as: devices that-

> (A) have at least one transducer (sensor or actuator) for interacting directly with the physical world, have at least one network interface, and are not conventional Information Technology devices, such as smartphones and laptops, for which identification and implementation of cybersecurity features is already well understood; and

(B) can function on their own and are not only able to function when acting as a component of another device, such as a processor.<sup>14</sup>

With this common definition and scope, the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act next moved to achieve greater data protection and cybersecurity in IoT devices. Recognizing it was best to start with a lofty but achievable goal, Congress started with IoT products the U.S. government will be buying.<sup>15</sup> The stated goal is to establish minimum security standards for IoT “devices owned or controlled by the Federal Government, and for other purposes.”<sup>16</sup> Starting with devices purchased by the federal government, Congress reasoned, would lead to a “trickle down” approach over time to the majority of, if not all, devices, as IoT devices would ultimately be in the Department of Defense supply chain or be closely associated with it and would need the required security features to operate in their interactions with the federal government.<sup>17</sup>

Senators unanimously supported the legislation, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia stated: “[m]ore and more products and even household appliances today have software functionality and internet connectivity... few incorporate even basic standards and protection.”<sup>18</sup> Now with new mandates levied on IoT manufacturers desiring to sell to the federal government, states are looking to do the same. Recently, California and Oregon enacted legislation to forbid the sale of devices that do not have “reasonable” baseline security measures.<sup>19</sup> In due time, as more states review the security vulnerabilities in IoT devices, they are likely to introduce legislation covering IoT devices sold locally. Potentially, in just a few years, all IoT manufacturers will have these minimum-security features designed into the end-product so that there are no restrictions on markets in which to sell. The federal IoT legislation should achieve its objective to raise the bar on IoT’s enabled cybersecurity features.

Remarkably, this legislation was welcomed by all parties, legislators, consumers, and manufacturers alike. As the minimum standards were achievable, there was no appetite or desire to contest the mandate. In some

cases, manufacturers will naturally exceed the minimum requirements attempting to market to the discriminating consumer seeking quality and embedded security features.

Several leaders in the field and impacted manufacturers have advocated for and endorsed the IoT legislative approach.<sup>20</sup> Below are highlights by leaders in the field and impacted manufacturers advocating and endorsing the IoT legislative approach: Jonathan Zittrain, Co-Founder of Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, praised the legislation and said:

> Internet-aware devices raise deep and novel security issues, with problems that could arise months or years after purchase, or spill over to people who are not the purchasers. This bill deftly uses the power of the Federal procurement market, rather than direct regulation, to encourage Internet-aware device makers to employ some basic security measures in their products <sup>21</sup>

Similarly, Denelle Dixon, Chief Business and Legal Officer at Mozilla, stated: “This bill makes important strides in refocusing attention on how to secure the government’s systems and networks. [These] reforms help safeguard the vast amounts of personal and sensitive information that the government holds but would also help to secure the products that people use every day.”<sup>22</sup> Another supporter of the legislation was Josh Corman, Director of Cyber Statecraft Initiative, Atlantic Council. He agreed that 

> Our dependence on connected technology is growing faster than our ability to secure it … we have created the conditions such that the actions of any single outlier can have a profound and asymmetric impact on human life, economic, and national security. Poor cyber hygiene represents a public health issue – and even threat to human life. It is encouraging to see what the federal government can do to raise the bar (both for their use and the marketplace). We know other countries and private sector initiatives are waking up to the need [to secure technologies].”.<sup>23</sup>

In summary, the United States supports innovation in technology, but desires that IoT devices have basic cybersecurity features. At the end of the day, Americans’ data privacy and confidentiality should be assured, as they may connect to up to a dozen IoT devices daily. The IoT legislation

<sup>23</sup> Also, Michelle Richardson, Deputy Director of the Freedom, Security and Technology Project, Center for Democracy and Technology opined: "We urgently need to start securing the Internet of Things and starting with the government's own devices is an important first step. This legislation will push government devices to meet modern security standards and ensure that researchers who act in good faith can independently verify the security of those devices. We hope that Congress will consider this proposal soon and look forward to a discussion about the security of government systems, where the market for Internet of Things devices is headed, and how independent research can contribute." *Id*.

is a step in the right direction, and many agree it achieved the right balance.<sup>24</sup>

*B. Are Cybersecurity Risks Common in IoT?*
IoT devices are designed for unique purposes and applications. Generally, their capabilities are not necessarily robust enough to incorporate more sophisticated cybersecurity protocols.<sup>25</sup> As such, cybersecurity risks are common in IoT. The challenges and security threats that have arisen are a direct result of the ubiquitous nature and “enthusiastic” adoption of IoT across business enterprise systems.<sup>26</sup>

The IoT field has an element of regulatory complexity. According to Ed McNichols, of Ropes & Gray, “regulation in the U.S. is done primarily sector by sector,” but IoT is different as it crosses multiple sectors.<sup>27</sup> Chemical, nuclear, financial, medical, and defense industries all use IoT. With IoT cutting across all of these, regulation and oversight are muddled.<sup>28</sup> Spanning various sectors yields fragmentation, which makes universal regulation across sectors unlikely. Notwithstanding the importance of cyber-secure IoT devices for both the economy and the consumer, there is not one approach for cybersecurity protocols for all IoT devices.<sup>29</sup>

Another area of a common cybersecurity risk for IoT is the lack of rigorous protocols, such as firewalls. IoT devices usually do not transmit high value data such as financial information transmitted to and from banks. <sup>30</sup> The lack of protocols brings along a false sense of security. For example, typically the data IoT devices transmit, while sensitive, are generally not a company’s highly valued data. Thus, if the data transmission is breached, the risk will be deemed low, which is not necessarily true. The IoT devices can often provide the avenue to a company’s crown jewels, which is where the danger sets in. “IoT devices are low hanging fruits for attackers to get into a company’s IT infrastructure,” says May Wang, a senior engineer at Palo Alto Networks.<sup>31</sup>

Another common cybersecurity risk is when a consumer buys a lowtech IoT device, also known as plug-and-play. Manufacturers generally “do not have many ways to communicate about a patch or a fix.”<sup>32</sup> McNichols’s concern is that IoT is not maintained in the same way as

<sup>24</sup> This measured approach has been applauded, and now there is an eye to seeing where regulation may creep as IoT device manufacturers embrace nanosatellite constellations for their operational success.

software is maintained, such as a software update notice in one’s laptop.<sup>33</sup> Vulnerabilities will arise as users cannot or may not update the devices. The failure to update or patch “gives hackers a roadmap to get into the device.”<sup>34</sup>

Finally, vulnerability researchers reported multiple, validated findings with IoT, or smart coffee machines. These coffee makers gave hackers the route to home networks, also known as a “back door,” which then allowed access to other devices on the home network. <sup>35</sup> An early discovery of the vulnerabilities of one device manufactured by Mr. Coffee was helpful for the industry as it raised concerns with basic kitchen and home appliances. <sup>36</sup> The attention led to follow-on work by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). <sup>37</sup> Some academics even suggested it led to the initial drafting of the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020. <sup>38</sup>

*C. What Are the Top Attacks to IoT?*

As mentioned above, IoT devices are not necessarily robust enough to incorporate cybersecurity features and later software updates. As one would expect, concurrent with rapidly expanding sales and usage of IoT devices with cybersecurity weaknesses, there has been a marked increase in cybersecurity hacking incidents. After a consumer purchases a product and plugs it in at home, the IoT device may collect, contain, or transmit data. This data would be appropriate to the nature of the device, such as health and fitness monitoring, and pulse monitoring. <sup>39</sup>

The findings of the Palo Alto Networks’ “2020 Unit 42 IoT Threat Report,” were alarming, but not unexpected.<sup>40</sup> Their findings reveal that IoT attacks result from:

- 41% exploiting device vulnerabilities, which included injection and overflow attacks; 

- 33% attacking via malware, botnets and ransomware; 

- 13% attacking compromised passwords, mostly due to exploits of one’s failure to change default passwords; and

- 13% of attacks target users through phishing and similar tactics.<sup>41</sup>

The common issue rests on a common practice: 98% of IoT device traffic on enterprise customer networks “remain unencrypted.”<sup>42</sup> For example, cameras capture photography and videos. These cameras are connected to an unencrypted network to transmit digital data which raises hacking risks. <sup>43</sup> Therefore, cybercriminals use these low-tech, low-threat IoT devices as the means to a company’s network, where the more valuable or lucrative data is accessible. Low-tech is no longer low risk, as one hack of an IoT device can compromise a business's most sensitive data or intellectual property.

A notable IoT breach occurred in 2017 at an unnamed casino in Las Vegas, where a connected thermometer in one of the aquariums became unsecured.<sup>44</sup> While this was a wake-up call to some, one can imagine that not all thermometer consumers were made aware of the product’s vulnerability so as to make course corrections and secure such “stepping stones,” to decrease the risk of cyber-attacks.<sup>45</sup> The “2019 Cybersecurity Readiness Review” reported that adversaries stole up to $6 billion in intellectual capital from the industry that supports the United States Department of Defense. <sup>46</sup> While the $6 billion was not all from IoT cyber-attacks, IoT devices can be the “weakest link.” As such, it is no surprise that manufacturing and telecommunications industries and Congress all overwhelmingly supported the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020.”<sup>47</sup>

Researchers recognize that IoT and device vulnerability concerns are rising and are now exploring if space-based internet can increase security. With decreased terrestrial connections, there should be reduced hacking into home networks where IoT devices currently connect.
