## V. THE UNITED STATES’ STANDING IN ITS SPACE INVESTMENTS
The U.S. has always been a leader in space, as evidenced by having the highest number of satellites in orbit. This could change with this new international awakening to what is on the horizon. The U.S. should take deliberate steps to demonstrate support for its commercial space activities. For example, it could increase the budgets of the federal regulatory agencies to aid in swifter processing of space licenses.<sup>113</sup> A more welcoming approach to space will assist in sustaining and promoting economic prosperity.<sup>114</sup>

There is much excitement in the U.S. surrounding Elon Musk’s SpaceX. However, his model will not work for smaller space technology companies without large research and development budgets. Accordingly, the U.S. Congress should look to seize the moment to take an affirmative step to zealously advocate for U.S. commercial space investments before these businesses look to other countries with less regulation. There is some positive movement as efforts are underway to relax strict licensing requirements. Specifically, these efforts aim to consolidate and streamline the regulatory framework and organizations for U.S. commercial space capabilities.<sup>115</sup>

While the U.S. Congress has reviewed the issue, legislation needs to be passed. On an optimistic note, legislation was previously introduced. In view of the case studies of Spain and France, there should now be momentum to pass the legislation. Specifically, in the 115th Congress, the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act and the Space Frontier Act included provisions to streamline the current onerous licensing process. <sup>116</sup> In the 116th Congress, the American Space Commerce Free

(stating that “[t]he demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude…. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video.").

Enterprise Act of 2019 was introduced by Rep. Brian Babin, ranking member of the House Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics. <sup>117</sup> Rep. Babin seeks to affirm American competitiveness and security and believes the U.S. could lose its “commercial space entrepreneurs, industry jobs, and innovative technology because of our slow, uncertain, and difficult regulatory process.” His bill was not passed.<sup>118</sup>

If the U.S. Congress supports space investment through tax credits and regulatory relaxation – as France and Spain did – the U.S. will be poised to both embrace these opportunities and remain the world leader in space technology. The U.S. Congress recently rallied behind the Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020 and passed it unanimously. <sup>119</sup> So, there is both a precedent and optimism that there could be “Satellite IoT” legislation and a firm commitment of support.<sup>120</sup> The U.S. should invest in nanosatellite technology to both address the need for data transmission capacity for IoT expansion and the American industry’s desire to invest in space assets.
