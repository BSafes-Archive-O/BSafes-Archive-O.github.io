## 2. Addressing Institutional Racism
Effective change requires addressing institutional racism that consists of policies and practices which reinforce racial inequities in a nation’s institutions—i.e., education, housing, government, employment, and religion.<sup>62</sup> Direct and ongoing challenges to racist practices and policies by social and civil rights movements are essential. The civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s as well as Black Lives Matter today play these vital roles. A comparison between issues in two seminal reviews of race relations and inequality in American life between 1945 and 1989 show the long-term progressive effects of civil rights efforts.<sup>63</sup> Perhaps, the next review will show the effects of the Black Lives Matters movement.

A strategically important institution with extraordinary potential to move the US toward acknowledging and then resolving its genocides and reducing racism are primary, secondary, and higher education.<sup>64</sup> The American public needs to be educated about both the history of American genocides and the outcomes of these genocides in continued racism against Native and African Americans, and other people of color. A new UNESCO sponsored publication reviews how this is being done internationally with potential lessons for the US.<sup>65</sup> Documentary films is another way to deploy such an education and have been a very effective educational medium for some time.<sup>66</sup> Some programming already exists on issues related to African and Native American history and experiences. However, the variety and types of documentaries and feature programs need to be broadened. There is a need for documentary series on the transatlantic slave trade, slavery, and the genocide of Native peoples in the Western Hemisphere and the US.

There is a particular recommendation regarding the teaching of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery that should apply to teaching about the genocide of Native peoples as well.<sup>67</sup> Primary and secondary school teachers are not trained to teach these subjects, and if these subjects are taught improperly, racists could be emboldened, and African and Native American students humiliated. Care must be taken in presenting such material, interpreting it, in guiding student reactions to it and responding to parent questions and complaints.
