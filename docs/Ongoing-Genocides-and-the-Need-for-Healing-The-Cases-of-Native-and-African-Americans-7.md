## 3. Reducing Cultural Racism
Attitudes, beliefs and values practiced over generations become part of the cultural fabric. In this way, racial inferiority and superiority (hierarchy) are the mental blueprints of expected outcomes regarding race—cultural racism.<sup>68</sup> Without a simultaneous reduction in cultural racism, any progress in reducing institutional and individual racism will be eroded in time.

most serious challenge to cultural racism now comes from scholars and activist exploring whiteness.<sup>69</sup> Cultural racism sits squarely in white identity and as that identity is questioned and transformed so is cultural racism. Through civil rights, social movements, education, and challenges to whiteness, constituencies will evolve open to addressing American genocides. These constituencies can then be the basis of support for more direct efforts toward genocide acknowledgment and reconciliation. Strategic groups and activities can lead to broadening public support for acknowledgment and reconciliation of the American genocides. The following is a proposal for such a strategic approach based upon intergroup contact theory.<sup>70</sup>

### *A Local Approach Proposal*
Lobbying the Federal government to acknowledge the American genocides and to act toward reconciliation might seem the most direct and appropriate course of action. With support from a few Representatives and Senators, a law can be proposed and, if passed, can achieve such an acknowledgment of genocide. Indeed, there are hundreds of non-governmental organizations (law firms, policy institutes, and lobby groups) in and near Washington, D.C., that are responsible for virtually every bill passed in Congress and all the provisions within each bill. However, this top-down approach to social change is increasingly out of touch with emerging public discontent with Congress and government. Furthermore, a legislative approach to genocide reconciliation would be seen by many as just another way for high paid lobbyists to make money. In this setting, if a law was passed as the first action to acknowledge the American genocides and to reconcile the damage, it would generate strong opposition and have minimal effect. Most importantly, it would not result in genuine national reconciliation even if the law survived its opposition.

An approach that is more consistent with the historical origins of racism in the US is to start from the bottom up at the county and then state levels, building local bases before pushing for change at the federal level of government. It was at the state and county levels of government where slavery was practiced and where Native Americans were hunted down and killed. The opposition of congressional representatives and senators to acknowledge genocide and their failure to address institutional racism (and a host of other problems) comes from people in the counties and states they represent. It is no coincidence that the most effective civil rights activism during the 1960s took place precisely at the county and state levels in the Deep South. This is where slavery was practiced and where Jim Crow laws were passed to deny the equal rights of African Americans, and where state-sanctioned violence was meted out to those who sought change and to vote. Likewise, the most effective Indian rights activism took place in the Dakotas, where the Native American presence is the strongest and where the genocides that defined present-day Native oppression took place. If one negates or blunts racism at the local level, and it will deflate racism at the federal level.

In the US, a resource that can be used to facilitate change is now conveniently available. The 1850 and 1860 web-based historical census records provide the identity of slave owners by county within Southern States. There are court, deed, probate, and tax records dating back to the inception of these counties that provide records of property sales, sales of slaves, taxation, and the settlement of estates. From the 1870 census (the first census after the emancipation of slaves), it is also possible to identify former slaves and to link them to their former owners from the 1860 census. Then groups of related slaves and owners can be traced forward in time through census and county records to the present. There are also records of original Native lands, the names of first settlers, the division of lands, and who held land titles to the present. The descendants of Native people and settlers who cleared the land can also be linked. It is at

this county level where we propose that genocide acknowledgment and reconciliation can begin. It is historically inaccurate and problematic to treat all African Americans and all Native Americans as an injured class and all White Americans as having perpetuated slavery. Not everyone who identifies today as African and Native Americans are descendants of the American genocides, and the majority of White Americans are descendants of immigrants who were not slave masters and arrived after slavery ended.

### *Peer-to-Peer Resolution*
By working at the county level, we go directly and precisely to the heart of the denial of genocide, denial of responsibility for it, and shame and denial of slavery and Native American extermination. Bring the descendants of slave owners and settlers together with the descendants of enslaved Africans and Native people. These encounters can begin with two or three members of both sides. In a series of initial meetings, they can learn about one another, exchange information, learn about the history and circumstances that connect them and begin to address their interrelated strengths, denials, and family secrets. As dual-side leaders emerge, and as cross-group relationships develop, more family members on both sides can be encouraged to participate. If these encounters do not begin on-site where slavery was conducted, or where Native people were driven from the land, they should eventually gather there. Family members who have knowledge of their histories are ideal facilitators of these encounters. In cases where there are insufficient family knowledge and leaders to conduct such meetings, non-family facilitators will be necessary.

County-level slave-master or Native-settler pairs that work together have the potential to come to terms with their histories and devise appropriate contemporary responses that can lead to reconciliation. As of 2016, there are 3007 counties in the US and as many historical variations in slavery and Native genocide that could only be addressed accurately where these histories took place and among direct descendants. A few successful encounters and county truth and reconciliations can then serve as models and examples of authentic acknowledgment and reconciliation, which will encourage more dual-descendant encounters. A precedent already exists to such a process and is underway for a famous American family. Some descendants of the third President of the US, Thomas Jefferson, who drafted the US Constitution, agreed to DNA testing, and then acknowledged the descendants of Sally Hemming, the slave with whom Jefferson had a parallel, hidden, and slave family.<sup>71</sup> Descendants of both lineages have met several times at the historic Jefferson estate, Monticello. This beginning could evolve into a more in-depth truth and reconciliation process for the Jefferson descendants. No one is keeping track of similar master-slave descendant gathering such as one that occurred recently in Prospect Hill, Mississippi.<sup>72</sup> It is too early to know if such gatherings are effective reconciliation steps, since they are just starting.

If a critical mass of descendant encounters and shared relations evolve, state reconciliation associations can form to advocate for acknowledgment and reconciliation of the American genocides from the broader public. If the descendants of slave masters, enslaved Africans, settlers, and Native people can come together and confront racism, their histories, traumas, and guilt, why cannot the rest of the American public? This would be an excellent project for targeted private foundation support to increase the numbers of encounters and truth and reconciliations, to develop facilitators, and to show best practices in forming and facilitating such descendant gatherings. At some point, with enough experience, expertise, support, a national acknowledgment, and reconciliation of genocide will be feasible at the federal level.

### *Reflection on Reparations*
Finally, local slavery and native genocide encounters can cut through another contentious issue, reparations.<sup>73</sup> Arguments for financial compensation to individuals from the federal government have been made elsewhere.<sup>74</sup> Another consideration is that local reconciliations can narrowly focus who should receive reparations, and what they should receive. It is imprecise that all African and all Native Americans should receive the same reparation and that all European Americans are equally liable. It is also problematic that the federal government is the only governmental unit held responsible, while the direct involvement of state and municipal governments in propagating slavery and Native genocide is ignored. Reparations could be refined and based on precise assessments of who did exactly what to whom. One does not have to look deeply into the history of slavery and Native elimination to realize that all enslaved Africans and Native peoples were not oppressed and traumatized in the same way and to the same degree. Current notions of reparation do not consider that our knowledge about slavery is based primarily on large plantation slavery while, at least in North Carolina, most slaves labored on small farms about which we still know very little.<sup>75</sup> The elimination of Western plains’ Indians took place in a relatively short time frame and was not nearly as thorough as that of Eastern Indians whose struggle started two hundred years earlier and who were subjected to the Trail of Tears.

Through local descendant reconciliation and healing, the descendants of perpetrators and victims can work out what would be the most appropriate reparation. Then reparations can be based upon their reconciliation and healing rather than some forced, imprecise, and imposed formula. Without direct descendants involved, reparations may neither fairly compensate the propriate descendants of victims nor have the descendants of those who committed genocide acknowledge their fore parents’ actions. However, there is a critical pre-condition to any reparations that has not yet been met. The genocide of slavery and the elimination of Native people has not ended. Racism is the legacy of both genocides and must still to be confronted and dealt with. The cost of reparations is still mounting.
